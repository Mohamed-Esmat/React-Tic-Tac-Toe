# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with React

## Overview
This project is a React-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It was developed as part of my revision of frontend development skills while following the **"React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)"** course by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**. The project focuses on key React concepts, including state management, component composition, lifting state up, and performance optimization.

## Live Demo
[Click here to play the game](https://react-tic-tac-toe-esmat.vercel.app/)

## Features
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Splitting UI elements into reusable components.
- **State Management**: Managing game state using `useState` effectively.
- **Component Isolation**: Ensuring that component instances work independently.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying different UI elements based on game state.
- **State Updates**: Updating state correctly based on previous values.
- **User Input Handling**: Implementing two-way data binding.
- **Multi-Dimensional List Rendering**: Displaying the game board dynamically.
- **Immutable State Updates**: Following best practices for updating object state.
- **Lifting State Up**: Managing shared state across multiple components.
- **State Optimization**: Reducing unnecessary state and using computed values.
- **Derived State from Props**: Calculating state values dynamically based on props.
- **Shared State**: Ensuring data consistency across multiple components.
- **Computed Values Optimization**: Deriving computed values from other computed data.
- **Conditional Button Disabling**: Preventing invalid moves.
- **Outsourcing Data**: Structuring data in separate files for maintainability.
- **Game Over Handling**: Detecting winning conditions and draw scenarios.
- **Immutability Best Practices**: Avoiding direct state mutations.
- **Alternative State Management Approaches**: Exploring different techniques beyond lifting state up.
- **Final Polishing**: Refining UI and improving component structures.
